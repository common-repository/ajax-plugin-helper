== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why isn't any of this plugins functionality working? =

You likely have Javascript disabled or you are using a browser that doesn't support Javascript.  This plugin requires Javascript to function.

= Why do I not have Ajax Delete or Ajax Upgrade links? =

In order for these links to show up WordPress has to determine if PHP can perform the necessary file system level tasks without prompting for FTP or SSH/SFTP login information. See [Editing wp-config.php](http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#FTP.2FSSH_Constants) and [Using SSH to Install/Upgrade](http://www.firesidemedia.net/dev/wordpress-install-upgrade-ssh/) for information on configuring WordPress to not prompt you for this information.

= Why can't I use the Ajax functions on the Ajax Plugin Helper itself? =

Using the Ajax Plugin Helper to perform the functions provided by the plugin would cause several things to break since it would become deactivated before it could perform all of its required functions.  Because of this you will not have Ajax links added to the Ajax Plugin Helper plugin.

= Does this plugin work with WordPress Mu? =

Yes.  Just place it in `wp-content/plugins`.  Please note that it does not yet add an Ajax Activate Site Wide link yet.  The Activate Site Wide links will just operate just as it did before.
